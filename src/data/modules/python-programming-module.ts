Basic modes include: "r" (read, default), "w" (write, creates/truncates), "a" (append), "x" (exclusive creation), plus "t" (text, default) or "b" (binary). The with statement creates a context manager that automatically handles file closing: `with open(filename, mode) as file:`. Text file methods include read() (entire content), readline() (single line), readlines() (all lines as list), write() (write string), and writelines() (write sequence of strings). Binary files use methods like read(size) and write(bytes). The CSV module provides specialized functions for comma-separated values files.

More complex algorithms may use recursion (functions calling themselves) or dynamic programming (storing subproblem solutions).
