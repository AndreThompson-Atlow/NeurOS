# NeurOS Development Roadmap

## Current Status (as of August 2023)

NeurOS is currently in active development with a functional but incomplete implementation. The core learning frameworks are established but require significant enhancements to deliver the intended experience.

### Working Components
- Basic module management (adding, starting, completion)
- Module structure and EPIC learning framework foundation
- State management for learning sessions
- Reading mode for content consumption
- Initial implementation of Chronicle dungeon system

### In Progress / Needs Improvement
- Download phase missing proper knowledge checks
- Install phase EPIC implementation needs depth
- Cross-module connections incomplete
- Review system functional but basic
- Chronicle dungeon system partially broken
- Thought analyzer integration incomplete
- Diagnostics system needs overhaul
- UI improvements needed for consistency

## Core Learning Flow

### Intended User Experience
1. **Reading Phase**: Initial exposure to module content
   - Users read through module content at their own pace
   - Build familiarity before active learning begins

2. **Download Phase**: Structured introduction to concepts
   - Multiple-choice knowledge checks for key concepts
   - Active recall exercises to solidify basic understanding
   - Assessment to determine readiness for installation

3. **Install Phase**: Deep learning through EPIC methodology
   - **Explain**: Articulate understanding of concepts
   - **Probe**: Answer multiple targeted questions about the concept
   - **Implement**: Apply knowledge to practical scenarios
   - **Connect**: Relate concepts to broader knowledge networks
   - Domain-level integration after completing all nodes
   - Module-level integration connecting to Core/Pillar concepts

4. **Review System**: Spaced repetition based on memory strength
   - Automated scheduling based on decay modeling
   - Prioritization of weak/decaying memories
   - Cross-module interleaving for stronger connections

5. **Chronicle System**: Gamified knowledge application
   - Dungeon exploration mapped to learning domains
   - Knowledge challenges through encounters
   - Battle system testing concept understanding
   - Rewards reinforcing learning progress

## Module Structure
- **Core Modules**: Foundational concepts (installed first)
- **Pillar Modules**: Connect to Core when installed
- **Auxiliary Modules**: Connect to Core and relevant Pillars (limited to 2-3 connections)

## Planned Features

### Near-term Priorities
- [ ] Add multiple-choice knowledge checks to Download phase
- [ ] Enhance EPIC implementation with multi-question probes
- [ ] Fix evaluation and feedback systems
- [ ] Implement cross-domain and cross-module challenges
- [ ] Repair Chronicle dungeon crawler functionality
- [ ] Overhaul diagnostics system for comprehensive testing
- [ ] Improve UI consistency across all pages

### Future Features
- [ ] Brain training games (arithmetic, vocabulary, logic)
- [ ] Voice-to-voice interaction with AI tutors
- [ ] Enhanced visualization of cognitive/memory maps
- [ ] Advanced analytics on learning patterns
- [ ] Social learning features
- [ ] Mobile application

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Core Learning Flow
- Implement knowledge checks in Download phase
- Enhance EPIC steps with proper depth and evaluation
- Add domain and module integration challenges
- Ensure proper Reading → Download → Install flow

### Phase 2: Technical Infrastructure
- Standardize API calls and error handling
- Complete thought analyzer integration
- Fix Chronicle system core functionality
- Improve review scheduling algorithm

### Phase 3: Polish and Expansion
- Complete UI improvements
- Add brain training games
- Implement voice interaction
- Expand visualization capabilities

## Priority Guidelines
1. Focus on making core learning flow (Reading → Download → Install) robust
2. Ensure evaluation feedback is helpful and accurate
3. Fix critical bugs before adding new features
4. Maintain consistent documentation
