# **App Name**: NeuroOS Module Player

## Core Features:

- Content Display: Display module content in a structured format (domains and nodes).
- Progress Tracking: Track user progress through the module, domain, and node structure.
- Probe Question Generation: Generate challenging questions that test deeper understanding. LLM will use reasoning as a tool to decide if the questions incorporate pieces of information in the module.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and focused learning environment.
- Secondary color: Dark gray (#333333) for text and important elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) to highlight interactive elements and progress indicators.
- Clear separation of content sections (module, domain, node) using visual cues.
- Use simple icons to represent different learning phases (Download, Install) and EPIC components.
- Subtle transitions between nodes and domains.
