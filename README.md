# NeuroOS

NeuroOS is a learning application designed to help users improve their cognitive abilities through structured learning experiences.

## Recent Fixes

### 1. Local Storage Issues
- Added version tracking to localStorage data
- Improved error handling for localStorage operations
- Added safeguards to prevent data corruption
- Implemented proper fallbacks when localStorage is unavailable

### 2. Thought Analyzer
- Fixed the feature flag mechanism for the thought analyzer
- Simplified the evaluation path when thought analyzer is disabled
- Improved type definitions for analyzer-related data structures

### 3. Code Documentation and Organization
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all major functions
- Improved file-level documentation with clear descriptions of module purpose
- Fixed type definitions and circular references
- Added explicit type annotations to avoid implicit 'any' types
- Organized code with logical sections and explanatory comments

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

#### Still Outstanding:
- Some type definitions need to be updated (e.g., for EvaluateResponseInput)
- The chronicle module needs further implementation
- UI improvements needed for better user experience
- Mock data should be replaced with actual API calls

#### To Fix Type Errors:
1. In `src/types/neuro.ts`, ensure proper imports from chronicle module
2. Create or update the EvaluateResponseInput type definition

## Code Standards

### Documentation Standards
- **File Headers**: Each file should have a JSDoc-style header describing the file's purpose and module functionality
- **Function Documentation**: All functions should be documented with JSDoc comments describing:
  - Purpose of the function
  - Parameters (with types)
  - Return values (with types)
  - Any side effects
- **Code Organization**: Code should be organized into logical sections with comments separating major blocks
- **Type Definitions**: All types should be explicitly defined and exported from their respective modules

### Best Practices
- Avoid implicit `any` types
- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Implement graceful fallbacks for failed operations
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
